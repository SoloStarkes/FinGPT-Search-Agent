# FinGPT-Search-Agent

Vision: This is a search agent specifically tailored towards the financial domain that can educate the user with any topic relating to finance, and direct the user towards accurate and reliable information by providing the user with the sources that the agent used to generate its response.

1. A search agent that provides financial commentary, analysis, and news on stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and other investment instruments. Will function as a place where users want to find financial related information.
2. Can provide precise answers in question-answering systems by considering the full context, outperforming traditional search engines. It's a powerful search and retrieval engine that can quickly locate relevant financial information from various sources, such as reports, filings, and databases.
3. With every generated response, it will essentially cite the sources from which it got the information from, all while ensuring that the sources that the agent pulls information from is reliable and accurate.
4. Ensure the system can accurately parse and extract data from XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) documents, which are commonly used for financial reporting.
5. Can act as a "Robo-Advisor" for users that want advice or suggestions on topics or situations.


Things to add/Fix(Issues):

1. When clear button is pressed it clears the information on the page too which it shouldn't
2. Add the current site its on as one of the sources or somewhere on the bot
3. Have the chatbot be able to be minimzied and maximized ( maybe start it in the corner)
4. Have the user be able to change the dimensions of the bot 
5. Improve overall UI to be more aeshetically pleasing
6. Improve the way the sources are displayed( similiar way to perplexity maybe)
